# Presentation

This is the Searchbot, a small tool which makes researches in large databases faster. You can ask it to search keyword occurrences in a database composed of any number of files and folders you want, and it will output the search on its screen and in a PDF file composed of all the pages of the documents in which the keyword appears in.
This tool is still in active development, if you encounter issues, or if you have requests, feal free to create an issue on this repository, and I will do my best to tackle it.

# How to use it

Sending a query to the bot is made in 3 steps:
- Choose the type of search you want (Synonym or Root search)
- Enter the keyword you are looking for in the query field
- Choose both database directory and output directory

# Current limitations

Here is a list of the limitations of the tool, which will be tackled by the following updates:
- Only PDFs files are being scanned by the tool
- There is no help button to get access to the documentation
- There is no progress bar indicating the current state of the search
