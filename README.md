# Improvements

The V4 brings several improvements:
- Reworking of the file system: merged both synonyms and root files into one
- Progress bar (not implemented for now): this shows the progress of the research, instead of having no informations
- Help button (not implemented for now): this opens the documentation, explaining how the tool works

# Bug solving
