# Improvements

The V4 brings several improvements:
- Reworking of the file system: merged both synonyms and root files into one
- Progress bar: this shows the progress of the research, instead of having no informations
- Help button: this opens the documentation, explaining how the tool works
- Textbox is now (a bit) bigger
- Added simple search, if we want to look for a specific word and not be bothered by other results

# Bug solving

- Fixed highlighting problems in the output file for the root search
- Fixed coloration problems on the console for the root search
- Fixed automatic switch to darkmode when opening the progressbar window

# Details

- Added titles explaining what directory you are looking for when one directory search window is opened
